# Preface {-}

This documentation is a primer for the COVID-19 DCTT BCS-2032203 project. It covers an introduction to Git, using Git in RStudio, an introduction to RMarkdown, the project repository, and project helper scripts.

This documentation assumes an introductory understanding of the R programming language and RStudio. It also assumes zero knowledge of Git, using Git in RStudio, and RMarkdown; consequently, some explanations may be structured or phrased in a way that are conducive to understanding but not perfectly accurate.
